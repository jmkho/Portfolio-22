## Portfolio-22
Compilation of my programming projects [individual &amp; group].


Hi everyone! So this is a quick overview of the best projects I had made throughout my college years (2020 ~ now). 
A lot of them were created with help from my other teammates so kudos to you guys! 
p.s. I created sub-readme files for every project. Please check them out for a better understanding of each project :)

I guess that's all that I can explain this. Don't hesitate to contact me for further inquiries. Au revoir! ðŸ‘‹
