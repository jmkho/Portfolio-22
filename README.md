## Portfolio-22
Compilation of my programming projects (individual &amp; group).


Hi everyone! So these are several projects I made during my college years (2020 ~ now) with various programming languages, focusing on C Programming Language back in the days but currently I've been challenging myself with Python Programming Language that mainly focuses on Machine Learning. 


Feel free to check out my projects! I hope you can find something interesting here.
