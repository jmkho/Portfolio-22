# Portfolio-22
Compilation of my programming projects [individual &amp; group].


Hi! So this is a quick overview of the best projects I had made throughout my college years (2020 ~ now). 
A lot of them were created with helps from my other team mates so kudos to you guys! 
p.s. I wanted to put your names here but I think the list will be too long, so instead I put your names along with the README explanation of each projects. You can check it there ;)

I guess that's all that I can explain for this. Don't hestitate to contact me for further inquiries :) Au revoir! ðŸ‘‹
